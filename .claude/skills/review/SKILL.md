# Review

Three-axis review of the diff between `HEAD` and a fixed point:

- **Standards** — does the code follow this project's documented conventions?
- **Spec** — does the code do what the originating spec asked for?
- **Discipline** — does the code follow the standing engineering rules?

Each axis runs as a subagent with its own context. The isolation is the point:
one axis must not be able to mask another, and a reviewer that has read all
three sets of sources will weigh them against each other instead of reporting
each cleanly.

## 1. Pin the fixed point

Whatever the user said is the fixed point — a commit SHA, branch name, tag,
`main`, `HEAD~5`. Don't be opinionated; pass it through. `$ARGUMENTS` carries it
when supplied.

When invoked from the task process at share, the fixed point is the branch's
merge-base with `origin/main` — don't ask. Otherwise, if none was given, ask
"Review against what — a branch, a commit, or `main`?" and don't proceed
without it.

Capture two things, once:

```
git diff <fixed-point>...HEAD      # three-dot: compares against the merge-base
git log <fixed-point>..HEAD --oneline
```

Pass the diff *command* to the subagents, not its output. They run it
themselves. Reading the diff into this context before dispatching defeats the
isolation and costs you the context you need for aggregation.

## 2. Identify the spec source

In order:

1. The open PR's body and comments (`gh pr view`) — the task process opens each
   PR with the brief as its body, and the brief's user stories are the spec.
2. Issue references in the commit messages (`#123`, `Closes #45`) — fetch with
   `gh issue view <number>`. A plan issue found this way holds the cut's
   stories.
3. A path the user passed as an argument.
4. A spec file under `docs/`, `specs/`, or `.scratch/` matching the branch name.

If nothing is found, ask the user where the spec is. If they say there isn't
one, skip the Spec axis and say so in the report — an unreviewed axis is a
result, not a silence.

## 3. Identify the standards sources

Collect paths, don't read them. The Standards subagent reads its own sources.

- `CLAUDE.md`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `CONTEXT.md`, `CONTEXT-MAP.md`, per-context `CONTEXT.md` files
- `docs/adr/` — architectural decisions are standards
- Any `STYLE.md`, `STANDARDS.md`, `STYLEGUIDE.md` at the root or under `docs/`
- `.editorconfig`, `eslint.config.*`, `biome.json`, `prettier.config.*`,
  `tsconfig.json` — pass these too. The subagent reads them to know what
  tooling already covers, so it doesn't re-report what the linter catches.

## 4. Dispatch

Issue all three Task calls **in a single message** so they run concurrently.
Each agent carries its own brief, so pass inputs only.

| Agent | Inputs |
| --- | --- |
| `standards-reviewer` | diff command, commit list, standards-source paths |
| `spec-reviewer` | diff command, commit list, spec path or fetched contents |
| `discipline-reviewer` | diff command, commit list |

`discipline-reviewer` loads the `engineering-discipline` skill itself — don't
paste rules into its message.

Pass nothing beyond the table. No summary of the change, no hint about what you
expect them to find, no note about which files you think matter. Each of those
is a way for your reading to contaminate theirs.

If there is no spec, dispatch two.

## 5. Aggregate

Lead with the verdict. The reader needs to know whether to act before they need
to know what was found.

**A finding blocks merge if it is any of:**

- a `MUST` violation from Discipline;
- a **Wrong** or **Missing** finding from Spec;
- a hard violation from Standards.

Everything else — SHOULD violations with no stated reason, judgement calls,
Unasked behavior, story/test mismatches, open questions — is worth reading and
does not block.

Format:

```
**<N> blocking, <M> non-blocking.** <one line naming the worst finding, or
"Nothing blocks merge.">

## Standards
<the subagent's report, verbatim or lightly cleaned>

## Spec
<...>

## Discipline
<...>
```

Do **not** merge, rerank, or deduplicate across the three reports. The axes are
separate so the user can see them independently, and a finding that appears in
two reports is telling you something a merged list would hide.

One overlap is deliberate and expected: a defensive branch that no story
describes will appear as **Unasked** under Spec and as `[FALLBACK-6]` under
Discipline. That is not duplication — the two axes disagree about what to do
about it, and both readings are useful. Leave both in.

If a subagent returns a clean report, keep it. "Standards: no violations" is
information, and dropping it makes the reader wonder whether the axis ran.

## Why three axes

A change can pass one and fail another:

- Follows every convention, implements the wrong thing → Standards pass, Spec
  fail.
- Does exactly what was asked, wrapped in fallbacks that will hide the next
  three failures → Spec pass, Discipline fail.
- Disciplined and correct, ignores the project's own decisions → Discipline and
  Spec pass, Standards fail.

Reporting them separately is what stops one from masking another.
